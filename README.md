This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for https://www.numfocus.org/ and any other web site operated by NumFOCUS, Inc., P.O. Box 90596, Austin, Texas, 78709 (“Provider”), and all related technologies, software, and services provided by Provider (collectively, the “Services”) . This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the Services. It will notify you of the following:

1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the Services, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
2. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
3. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
4. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

## Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We have access to/collect information that you voluntarily provide to us via email, online forms or other direct contact from you, such as your name, email address, home address, telephone number, and credit card information.

We will use your information to deliver the services you have requested, respond to you regarding the reason you contacted us, maintain our records, customize the content and layout of the Services, and to contact you regarding information about the Services, including updates and new services.

As is true of most websites, we also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files based upon usage of our Services. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Services, to track users’ movements around our sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.

We may share your information with third parties outside of our organization as necessary to provide the Services to you and to secure the Services. Identifying and non-identifying user information and data may be disclosed or distributed to a third party with which we enter or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger. We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about events, new or updated services, or changes to this privacy policy. Opting out of communications may be done by selecting the opt-out option in the communication itself. However, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Services, such as Services announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

## Your Access to and Control Over Information
You can do the following at any time by contacting us via email at info@numfocus.org:

- See what data we have about you, if any.
- Change/correct any data we have about you.
- Have us delete any data we have about you.
- Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

We reserve the right to confirm the identity of the requester and limit the frequency of an individual’s requests.

## Links
Our Services may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.

## Sharing
Aggregated demographic information may be shared with our partners and/or affiliates. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may partner with another party to provide specific services, such as credit card processing, and we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

## Cookies
The Services use cookies and other similar technologies, in accordance with industry standards. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help us improve your access to the Services and identify repeat visitors to the Services. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to enter a password more than once, thereby saving time. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the user experience. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our sites. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of your information being used in this way, most computer systems and web browsers offer privacy settings and options, such as disabling cookies or opting for “Do Not Track” features. We do not override these settings or options, and encourage you to use them to enhance your choices and personalize your experiences.

## Security
We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information. Our infrastructure is hosted and managed within WP Engine. WP Engine manages risk and undergoes recurring assessments to comply with industry standards.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

Please be advised that the security and confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted through the Internet or any wireless network, including via the Services, email or text messages, cannot be and is not guaranteed.

## Updates
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.

**If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email at info@numfocus.org.**
